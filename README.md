### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
README 

My design is inspired by a cyberpunk neon theme comprised of hexagonal tiles and neon underlighting. I wanted the lighting to look electric in nature.

The the tiles themselves are made up of 3 hexagons layered to give the illusion of depth. One that mimics the colour of the light underneath to act as if it is lighting the sides of the tiles, a second the same size on top of it to dim the colour of the first and a third is a dark grey smaller sized hexagon to act as the main face of the tiles for the 3d effect.

The light underneath is made up of a grid of pixels changing colour corresponding to the animated noise underneath. The noise is made up of 2 colours. A cool red and bright blue which also blend at points to make a light purple, as a whole creating that contrasting cyberpunk look with the jittery speed of electricity.
